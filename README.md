# Hahn Echoes

The code can be found at `MeasuringDecoherence.ipynb`, and a pdf describing further theoretical details at `MeasuringDecoherence.pdf`.
An example of the code used to generate the animations is `animations_example.py`.
The submitted video can be found in [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4n8k31PpdHY).

This code and the video linked below were developped as part of the Quantum Future Challenge
2020, hosted by [ScienceatHome](https://www.scienceathome.org/quantum/qfa-2020) and Danish Universities Science Departments (Aarhus University, University of Copenhagen, DTU and SDU)

The code is heavily inspired from the [Qiskit Textbook](https://github.com/Qiskit/textbook/tree/main) and some other examples
found online, along with my own additions were the code was clumsy or difficult to follow.
